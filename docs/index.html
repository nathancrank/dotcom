Jimmy was quite the character, for a whole slew of reasons. Key among them, was his computer collection, or garbage pile, or debilitating hoarding problem, depending on how you looked it. He lived out a bit out of the city, in the country, on a parcel of land that used to be part of his father’s larger property. His house, garage and backyard easily contained 400-500 old computers, mostly Apples, and a some of old arcade hardware. His house was covered in computers and accessories and parts and boxes of old software, from wall to wall.</p>

<p>One day he decided to move to California. I knew he wasn’t going to take his insanely unmanageable collection and asked if I could salvage a few. I wish I had taken photos at the time. I left his place with what I could pack into my little Volvo. The rest of the collection he hauled out into the backyard and burned …</p>

Most of that time has been spent crafting things, such as attempting to construct a <a href="/dotcom/2016/12/28/failing-to-bring-tv-to-fallout.html">memory circuit</a>. But by far the largest time-sink has been rebuilding Sanctuary.</p>

The first night we had it, Emma and I built the robot from the booklet, loaded up the basic program provided, and made it drive around for a minute shooting little balls. Then, because it’s LEGO, I took it apart and began work on my own robot.</p>

The last section from the left features a little boy building a church like structure.' /><p>Late last night, while browsing craigslist to get an idea of what people sell LEGO for (it depends, but it’s largely by weight in pounds), I stumbled across a NO. 205 set at a local thrift shop. So late this afternoon, I went and bought it. In store it appeared to have at least the majority of its parts, and the parts seemed roughly right for the supposed age. So I bought it.</p>

Like enough that I’m surprised I’m not single. When the Wasteland Workshop DLC was released, I got very lost in it. The logic gates seemed to make possible potentially interesting things in game. Some people got pretty creative and implemented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fallout+4+half-adder">half-adders and built full calculators</a>. For some reason the fact that some people could create calculators gave me the confidence to create a TV. Why? Who knows.</p>
