His house, garage and backyard easily contained 400-500 old computers, mostly Apples, and a some of old arcade hardware. His house was covered in computers and accessories and parts and boxes of old software, from wall to wall. One day he decided to move to California.

<ul>
  <li>2 Lisas</li>
  <li>3 Lisa keyboards</li>
  <li>2 Lisa Profile hard drives</li>
  <li>2 Lisa Mice</li>
  <li>2 Apple IIcs</li>
  <li>2 Apple IIc monitors</li>
  <li>An Apple II joystick</li>
  <li>Apple IIe</li>
  <li>A NeXTstation</li>
  <li>A NeXTstation Keyboard</li>
  <li>A NeXT CRT Display</li>
  <li>Probably some other stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these items had been in his garage or backyard. Which is to say, they were not pretty. I then immediately stored them all in my parents attic for most of the following decade, with the intention of eventually restoring them if possible.</p>

<p>I now have that space and time. So I’ve pulled the 2 Lisas out, and begun working on them. I’ve done a cursory restoration of 2 of the keyboards, and the 2 mice, and I’ve disassembled one of the Lisa’s down to its components. I’ll post more about the restoration itself later.</p>

<p>It’s going to be difficult, but I want to get them into working order. My goal is to restore them as close to possible to their last working state, and to restore the casing as much as possible to its original state.</p>

<p>I’m going to adhere as close as is possible with a 30 year-old computer to original/OEM parts. To that effort, I already tracked down OEM key switch pads from a gentlemen who worked at Apple’s keyboard supplier Keytronic during the 80s. He just so happened to have a few thousand left over in great shape, and was very happy to finally part with a good chunk of them.</p>

<p>I’ll write more about the actual restorations, but in the meantime, enjoy some pictures.</p>
