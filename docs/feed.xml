Jimmy was quite the character, for a whole slew of reasons. Key among them, was his computer collection, or garbage pile, or debilitating hoarding problem, depending on how you looked it. He lived out a bit out of the city, in the country, on a parcel of land that used to be part of his father’s larger property. His house, garage and backyard easily contained 400-500 old computers, mostly Apples, and a some of old arcade hardware. His house was covered in computers and accessories and parts and boxes of old software, from wall to wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day he decided to move to California. I knew he wasn’t going to take his insanely unmanageable collection and asked if I could salvage a few. I wish I had taken photos at the time. I left his place with what I could pack into my little Volvo. The rest of the collection he hauled out into the backyard and burned …
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Lisas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Lisa keyboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Lisa Profile hard drives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Lisa Mice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Apple IIcs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Apple IIc monitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An Apple II joystick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple IIe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A NeXTstation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A NeXTstation Keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A NeXT CRT Display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probably some other stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these items had been in his garage or backyard. Which is to say, they were not pretty. I then immediately stored them all in my parents attic for most of the following decade, with the intention of eventually restoring them if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have that space and time. So I’ve pulled the 2 Lisas out, and begun working on them. I’ve done a cursory restoration of 2 of the keyboards, and the 2 mice, and I’ve disassembled one of the Lisa’s down to its components. I’ll post more about the restoration itself later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be difficult, but I want to get them into working order. My goal is to restore them as close to possible to their last working state, and to restore the casing as much as possible to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to adhere as close as is possible with a 30 year-old computer to original/OEM parts. To that effort, I already tracked down OEM key switch pads from a gentlemen who worked at Apple’s keyboard supplier Keytronic during the 80s. He just so happened to have a few thousand left over in great shape, and was very happy to finally part with a good chunk of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll write more about the actual restorations, but in the meantime, enjoy some pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of that time has been spent crafting things, such as attempting to construct a &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/28/failing-to-bring-tv-to-fallout.html&quot;&gt;memory circuit&lt;/a&gt;. But by far the largest time-sink has been rebuilding Sanctuary.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017-10-10-rs-Fallout+4_20161229210851-4f40eb02a273459ab8786a0aebb55872b909d06bd3504772d52a0d700dd5f5d6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this all on the PS4, with mods that enable more of the in game items in building mode. As should be immediately obvious if you’ve ever played the PS4 version, this town is massively over the settlement limit size. I managed to do this by finding a series of size-hacks. Originally anything you dropped and then removed would lower the settlement size; however, only a few days into this an update broke that. The second method I found was to remove a wire while in building mode with the desired item already selected. Once the wire is removed, you can place the item. During the build, the town was littered with conduits placed for my convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a brief tour.&lt;/p&gt;

The first night we had it, Emma and I built the robot from the booklet, loaded up the basic program provided, and made it drive around for a minute shooting little balls. Then, because it’s LEGO, I took it apart and began work on my own robot.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I wanted to replicate the Roomba’s basic self-driving functionality: driving in a crooked line until colliding with something, then avoiding that object and continuing on its way. This was pretty easy and I got a basic version working the first night.  That’s not to say it worked all that well. It featured a stationary distance sensor tucked into the front, and it simply couldn’t detect enough objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- https://adam.garrett-harris.com/how-to-easily-embed-youtube-videos-in-jekyll-sites-without-a-plugin/ --&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9Zbtu17REI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second evening, I added a pivoting arm to the front and moved the distance sensor there. This enabled it to sweep back and forth quickly, dramatically improving its ability to avoid.  It still got stuck under a lot of furniture that was above its view — an impact sensor on the upper portion of the arm solved this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017-03-10-lsb-E505BDEE-C2ED-43D1-BE3E-1dacb6c75bf4e25078476ad5a3d629d6cb5657eb2b8e405955a13dba9c336997.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it was a decent self-propelled, semi-autonomous driver. Not a good one, but a decent one. I figured as long as it was driving around, it might as well sweep. I wrapped some paper towel and felt around a few gears, plugged it into the rear right-side motor, and built a tray behind the robot to catch dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017-03-10-lsb-F7569689-C51C-4135-B3AD-cbe395174238d21c450c55ce67bffc55580ccfce88bb9fe0d8b02f1240734190.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, after driving around a while, it did pick up a bit of dirt and dog hair. It’s not efficient, but it does technically work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017-03-10-lsb-1489196389257-8d29fddfa9655c7321dda0f66784a47e26e51146b0dc00d56ca4c7b06d77445d.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was only possible because LEGO built an incredible product that packs the power of a small development board, like an Arduino, into something anyone could use. Software for the NXT 2 feels like a relic of when it was initially offered, circa 2006, but it was clearly a well developed product at that point. It’s easy to drop their action blocks onto the timeline and assemble some pretty powerful programs. The ability to select a few blocks from your entire program, then click one button and have them run on your NXT is something from which the Arduino could learn a trick or two. The software looks similar to a Scratch environment, but it definitely has its own take on the paradigm and is branded phenomally well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017-03-10-lsb-D5F2AD1E-12F9-4378-9018-9caa6f23a5504d53b8456d29970c7f48035ed3550a1c07a91dd4675816dafe2a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NXT 3 looks like a really solid update, and I might have grab that. Can’t wait to see what LEGO has in store for the next update.&lt;/p&gt;

So late this afternoon, I went and bought it. In store it appeared to have at least the majority of its parts, and the parts seemed roughly right for the supposed age. So I bought it.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2017-03-10-205-0C7108E4-D6C9-4448-BB15-614C7E636856-73d6d7c3b23321c191d27dbbf353b62d6b21bf0dade0128967ee6ec6d1984b19.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduced in 1966, the NO. 205 Beginner Set contains largely the standard bricks in white and red, but also a few yellow and blues, a mix of other basic sizes and shapes, a set of wheels, and some windows. My set appears to have 191 original parts, and five modern parts that must have joined the ride along the last 50ish years. The plastic is very different from even the oldest bricks I previously had in my collection. The bricks themselves also lack some of the structural elements of modern ones, which seems to make them harder to break apart when you want to, but easier to break apart by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white bricks appear to be of two slightly different constructions, one with a bit of extra plastic in a strip centered on the underside of the brick, presumably to add strength. The lugs on the bricks have two styles, one with a slightly chubbier, smaller, more Cooper-like typeface and a more modern looking version that is closer to the current san-serif, but not quite the same. From what I can tell, these differences seem to be related to the two different plants in which Samsonite made LEGOs under license at the time. After introducing Legos to the American market, Samsonite had to open a second factory to meet production. I’m not positive this explains the differences, but from what I can gather, it seems to. If anyone knows better, I’d love to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, here’s a bunch of pictures of old LEGOs. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

Like enough that I’m surprised I’m not single. When the Wasteland Workshop DLC was released, I got very lost in it. The logic gates seemed to make possible potentially interesting things in game. Some people got pretty creative and implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fallout+4+half-adder&quot;&gt;half-adders and built full calculators&lt;/a&gt;. For some reason the fact that some people could create calculators gave me the confidence to create a TV. Why? Who knows.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, Starlight Drive-in was an ideal place for the TV. So I set out to create a giant display in game, that I could display a basic 10 frame animation on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-12-27-ftv-1489196497361-cde1553fcd911c8ff28929ba4d5a5570eb4f88999959afb2ae7105ec60525058.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;
			Testing a memory circuit for a single pixel's buffer.
		&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I should mention is I have a PS4, and did all of this before the release of mods. This was all done with built-in and DLC settlement items. I defeated settlement sizes using a few different cheats that have slowly been disabled by patches. All items necessary to build anything were purchased legitimately in-game. All of this took more time than I should admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I built a TV, as you can see above. The TV is made up of 144 pixels: 16 horizontally, 9 vertically. Each pixel is built of 9 sub-pixel units: 3 red, 3 green, 3 blue. You can see the sub pixels below as I programmed them. Each pixel would be backed by a simple 3 bit buffer, each bit storing each sub-pixel color. This 432bit display buffer would then ideally be connected to a timing bus, a super basic memory I/O controller, a basic programmer, and a 4.38kilobit memory register to store video frames (3bits per frame per pixel, 6 bits per frame for stereo sound). The stereo sound was achieved by storing 6 extra bits, that represent two notes, one left channel, one right channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-12-27-ftv-Fallout+4_20160630214003-93857918b0815e453fdf39cf606407c2099b79ba88337131e7fcf05315baa1e6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiring everything was a lot of fun. By which I mean it was a real pain. Especially once the PS4’s memory limits were being pushed. I quick saved quite frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

			Wiring is so much fun.
		&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I realized I left no space for any real circuitry to hold the buffer, so I removed everything and rebuilt the TV in a big box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-12-27-ftv-Fallout+4_20160720191115-66184fd3b2034fc05d688574d646ce161fb514a219737f37a73e884a69caf493.jpg&quot; /&gt;

		&lt;figcaption&gt;
			Wiring the second time is even more fun.
		&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is where the real fun happens. I began work on the basic memory circuit. In retrospect, I should have done this prior to wiring that giant display, but you live, you learn, you get Luvs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that there are two input switches, one for controlling writing, and one for controlling if the bit is on or off. If the write switch is off, the stored bit cannot be changed. The write switch would be controlled by the timing bus eventually, switching on for every other timing pulse. The data switch is set while the write switch is off. The grid of images below shows how the circuit works. iCircuit is an amazing app by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-12-27-ftv-IMG_2519-492c3b429ec1cf3c900c5116725af49697d32c78919b69229765eeb1a4004f10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the bad news, and here is why the settlers of my Fallout community will not get to watch the glory of a 10 second gif: Logic Gates in Fallout 4 are completely broken. The basic issue is that it treats the electrical circuit as on or off, when in real electronics, its high or low. Essentially it’s two different binary systems at play, [1,0] vs [1,-1]. Anything that loops/buffers will not work. And even the much discussed online AND buffer hack will not resolve this. No matter how many ANDs you shove in there. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-12-27-ftv-1489196588766-e249c028a4e707c39910ba1815bf4042b1628651dc1d70746bde6c67b9b03f45.png&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;
			This doesn't work in Fallout 4's Logic Gate system.
		&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-12-27-ftv-1489196594513-0f84e39604cd9530e1a5b08c4dbcec798c86ee318881785a870aefd78019fd39.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;
			As you can see, this is broken.
		&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s it. With that failure, the project comes to an end. Unless Bethesda decides to fix it, it won’t work. And I don’t see them fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a lot of articles out there on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsd.org/advocacy/whyusefreebsd.html&quot;&gt;why you might want to use FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;, so I’ll leave that to smarter people than myself.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For most home projects that you can run on a PI, it probably doesn’t make much of a difference if you choose between FreeBSD’s current or stable branch. If you really need great stability, you probably need something better than a Raspberry Pi anyway, like anything with a hardware clock, a real power supply, a real disk interface, etc …&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole RaspberryPi page on FreeBSD’s site. If you make it to the end, there are links to download sd-card images. I did not do this initially, and instead started by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freebsd/crochet&quot;&gt;Crochet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freebsd/crochet&quot;&gt;Crochet&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a pretty cool utility. It’s great for building custom images for any development board that is supported, and looks like a great tool to help with getting it up on unsupported boards as well. Just remember that compiling kernels is not a fast activity regardless of your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pkg install is fantastic on an Intel machine, because basically every port has a binary snapshot available. That is not the case on anything in the arm world. There are a lot of ports that have no binary available, and so have to be compiled instead. There are also some ports that don’t work, or may pose some difficulty. The situation isn’t that different from other operating systems running on these arm development boards; however, the ports system is an advantage for FreeBSD here, because it’s trivial to get the source and compile most things. It’s obviously not that you can’t compile on other operating systems, its just that outside the BSD world, you’re OS is unlikely to provide the source code and some porting help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compiling takes forever on the slow little Pi. &lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/RPiconfig&quot;&gt;Overclock your Pi&lt;/a&gt; and lower the GPU ram before you start compiling. I strongly recommend running make config-recursive before you make install. It doesn’t totally solve the problem of having to babysit your compile answering config questions periodically, but it does at least remove a few more of those config screens.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overclocking your Raspberry Pi is still easy even without raspi-config. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/RPiconfig&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; to update the config.txt file on the sd card’s FAT partition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even overclocked to 950Mhz, the Pi took over a week to compile CUPs and its dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before using FreeBSD on the Pi you probably want to be fairly familiar with the Pi and with either FreeBSD itself, or *nix operating systems in general.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the best things about FreeBSD is the FreeBSD handbook. It’s an amazing resource for FreeBSD users, and honestly something that I think is integral to how nice an experience using FreeBSD is. The handbook is really well organized and is often the only thing you need to answer your question.&lt;/li&gt;

Consequently, I went for a deep dive into John the Ripper. Then I really lost all semblance of handling this responsibly like an adult by hopping on eBay and buying an old HP Proliant ML350 G5 to dedicate to cracking.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That server has arrived, and has been dubbed Marsellus Wallace. The hardware all seems to be in great shape, and it passed the HP Diagnostics. So yeah, its a box of computer parts that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2016-06-07-mar-1465341026998-0604acecf0e3c7a235535bd65f64e06792645f15fd2afd66385b879d2a4c5a5d.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;
			A bunch of old crap I own attached to Marsellus, yet another questionable, old thing I now own.
		&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve installed FreeBSD and WindowMaker on it, which if I say so myself, makes for a pretty nice little setup. It’s a little like using NeXTSTEP, except in 2016, with programs that are useful in 2016. It’s been fun to tinker with, and I have most definitely wasted too much time tinkering with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s move on to how I’m using it to break into my own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been having trouble getting John the Ripper to compile via the FreeBSD ports system. So for the time being, I’ve installed it using pkg install instead. I’ve also installed the Johnny UI to just make things easier on myself. Yeah, I could do it through the terminal, just like I could have typed this up in vim, but I don’t hate myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill up the john.pot file this time I’m taking a different, hopefully much better approach. Instead of just making a ton of user/pass pairs in GPG by hand, which was probably dumb to do in the first place, I’m going to crack a bunch of the 6+ million hashes recently dumped from &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/how-linkedins-password-sloppiness-hurts-us-all/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. The dump I found online doesn’t contain usernames, which is probably for the best as I don’t want to break into other people’s stuff, I just want to train my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also put together a new dictionary, containing several wordlist I found, including the infamous yourock.txt. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords&quot;&gt;Skull Security&lt;/a&gt; has a good number of other dictionaries as well. I’ve concatenated a large number of them, in a particular order, filtering out dupes. By no means is the one I’ve made amazing, but its more comprehensive than the one built into john, and it’s good enough for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve loaded all of that into john and let it go. In the last roughly 18 hours it’s cracked a little over 35,000 passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now need to go solve for building John on FreeBSD via ports with OpenMP support. The only thing I’ve found so far that’s been helpful is that Clang doesn’t support OpenMP, so GCC would need to be used. I’ve set it to use GCC5, but I’m still having issues building. Being limited to two cores for cracking is really holding Marsellus back. Once I solve that, I can recompile, rebuild charsets with a much better john.pot file, and start cracking my not so short, no so remembered, password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I never crack the stupid password, at least I’ve had some fun?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="security" /><summary type="html">Last time we left off, I had been overly clever and locked myself out of a lot of my computing life.

Then I have to do extra work to solve a problem created by that ever-present jackass, my past self. Anyways, here’s the lesson of one of those moments: how to make John the Ripper work on longer passwords.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I underwent the vaguely-yearly ritual of erasing my Mac in a fit of paranoia and then reinstalling “only the essentials”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a good computer person, I used long, strong passwords and strong encryption. I used a MacGPG derived solution to encrypt these passwords in a safe storage solution, not on any cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after doing this oh-so-smart thing, I promptly forgot my oh-so-clever GPG password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, fine enough. I wrote a little shell script to start going through all possible passwords between my two best guesses at a high bound and low bound of character count. It generated them, then passed it into GPG to unlock the file. On my 2011 Macbook Air, this speed was somewhere in the neighborhood of 2-3 guesses a second. And at well above 24 characters long, with a character set of around 70 potentials, this was not going to probably ever finish. The sun would probably collapse before this Macbook Air would finish cracking this password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to look into alternatives. I used John the Ripper back in the day to tear through a few passwords, so I decided to revist it. There is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper&quot;&gt;a community version called Jumbo&lt;/a&gt;, that includes support for a huge range of password types and sports a number of other improvements and experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, and this is important, it doesn’t do incremental passwords longer than 24 characters in length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to recompile it, changing CHARSET_LENGTH to whatever you want (I chose 60) in src/params.h before compiling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breaks all of the charset files included. So before you recompile it, do yourself a favor and crack a bunch of simple password pairs so that you can fill your john.pot file. Then recompile John. Then run ./makechr from the same folder as john. Now, you can crack long passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do be aware that cracking passwords above 24 characters using an incremental attack is most likely futile regardless of what hardware you have access too. I’m not optimistic that this will get me much further with my issue by itself. But now that John can handle larger passwords, I can move on to working with it’s other features like filters, custom charsets and other cracking methods. I know a number of things about the passwords probable structure, so I can probably help John not waste so much time going through every possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s currently maxing out at a pace of about 25 passwords a second in a Kali Linux VM with the VM settings maxed out, a much more respectable pace than my shell scripts 2-3, but still not much in the scheme of things. So because I’m not completely right in the head, I just bought a used HP Proliant server on eBay that will let me offload this work from my Air and perform a lot more calculations through its dual quad-core Xeons and disgusting amount of RAM. I guess I’ll post about what I do with that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="security" /><summary type="html">Sometimes, I’m too clever for my own good.
