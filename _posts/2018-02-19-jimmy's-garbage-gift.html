title: Jimmy's Garbage Gift

When I was an Apple Genius I had a boss named Jimmy. Jimmy was quite the 
character, for a whole slew of reasons. Key among them, was his computer 
collection, or garbage pile, or debilitating hoarding problem, depending on 
how you looked it. He lived out a bit out of the city, in the country, on a 
parcel of land that used to be part of his father's larger property. His 
house, garage and backyard easily contained 400-500 old computers, mostly 
Apples, and a some of old arcade hardware. His house was covered in 
computers and accessories and parts and boxes of old software,Â from wall to 
wall.

One day he decided to move to California.
