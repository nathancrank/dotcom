title: Failing to bring TV to Fallout
tag:

I've spent a lot of time in Fallout 4. Like enough that I'm surprised I'm 
not single. When the Wasteland Workshop DLC was released, I got very lost 
in it. The logic gates seemed to make possible potentially interesting 
things in game. Some people got pretty creative and implemented 
half-adders and built full calculators. For some reason the fact that some 
people could create calculators gave me the confidence to create a TV. Why? 
Who knows.
