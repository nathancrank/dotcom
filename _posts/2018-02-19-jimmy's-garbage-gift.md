When I was an Apple Genius I had a boss named Jimmy. Jimmy was quite the character, for a whole slew of reasons. Key among them, was his computer collection, or garbage pile, or debilitating hoarding problem, depending on how you looked it. He lived out a bit out of the city, in the country, on a parcel of land that used to be part of his father's larger property. His house, garage and backyard easily contained 400-500 old computers, mostly Apples, and a some of old arcade hardware. His house was covered in computers and accessories and parts and boxes of old software, from wall to wall.

One day he decided to move to California. I knew he wasn't going to take his insanely unmanageable collection and asked if I could salvage a few. I wish I had taken photos at the time. I left his place with what I could pack into my little Volvo. The rest of the collection he hauled out into the backyard and burned ...

- 2 Lisas
- 3 Lisa keyboards
- 2 Lisa Profile hard drives
- 2 Lisa Mice
- 2 Apple IIcs
- 2 Apple IIc monitors
- An Apple II joystick
- Apple IIe
- A NeXTstation
- A NeXTstation Keyboard
- A NeXT CRT Display
- Probably some other stuff

All of these items had been in his garage or backyard. Which is to say, they were not pretty. I then immediately stored them all in my parents attic for most of the following decade, with the intention of eventually restoring them if possible.

I now have that space and time. So I've pulled the 2 Lisas out, and begun working on them. I've done a cursory restoration of 2 of the keyboards, and the 2 mice, and I've disassembled one of the Lisa's down to its components. I'll post more about the restoration itself later.

It's going to be difficult, but I want to get them into working order. My goal is to restore them as close to possible to their last working state, and to restore the casing as much as possible to its original state.

I'm going to adhere as close as is possible with a 30 year-old computer to original/OEM parts. To that effort, I already tracked down OEM key switch pads from a gentlemen who worked at Apple's keyboard supplier Keytronic during the 80s. He just so happened to have a few thousand left over in great shape, and was very happy to finally part with a good chunk of them.

I'll write more about the actual restorations, but in the meantime, enjoy some pictures.
 
Don't be deceived, they are both in equal amounts awful condition.

Nothing a little retr0br1ght won't fix right?

Most of the board looks ok? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is fine.
