I recently acquired a Lego Mindstorms NXT 2 via work. The first night we 
had it Emma and I built the robot in their booklet, loaded up the basic 
program they provide, and it drove around shooting little balls for a 
minute. Then, because it's Lego, I took it apart and began work on my own 
robot.
