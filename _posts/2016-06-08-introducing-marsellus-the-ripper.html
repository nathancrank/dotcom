title: Introducing Marsellus the Ripper

Last time we left off, I had been overly clever and locked myself out of a 
lot of my computing life. Consequently, I went for a deep dive into John 
the Ripper. Then I really lost all semblance of handling this responsibly 
like an adult by hopping on eBay and buying an old HP Proliant ML350 G5 to 
dedicate to cracking.

That server has arrived, and has been dubbed Marsellus Wallace.
