Late last night, while browsing craigslist to get an idea of what people sell LEGOs for (it depends, but it's largely by weight in pounds), I stumbled across a NO. 205 set at a local thrift shop. So late this afternoon, I went and bought it. In store it appeared to have at least the majority of its parts, and the parts seemed roughly right for the supposed age. So I bought it.

Introduced in 1966, the NO. 205 Beginner Set contains largely the standard bricks in white and red, but also a few yellow and blues, a mix of other basic sizes and shapes, a set of wheels, and some windows. My set appears to have 191 original parts, and five modern parts that must have joined the ride along the last 50ish years. The plastic is very different from even the oldest bricks I previously had in my collection. The bricks themselves also lack some of the structural elements of modern ones, which seems to make them harder to break apart when you want to, but easier to break apart by accident.

The white bricks appear to be of two slightly different constructions, one with a bit of extra plastic in a strip centered on the underside of the brick, presumably to add strength. The lugs on the bricks have two styles, one with a slightly chubbier, smaller, more Cooper-like typeface and a more modern looking version that is closer to the current san-serif, but not quite the same. From what I can tell, these differences seem to be related to the two different plants in which Samsonite made LEGOs under license at the time. After introducing Legos to the American market, Samsonite had to open a second factory to meet production. I'm not positive this explains the differences, but from what I can gather, it seems to. If anyone knows better, I'd love to find out.

Anyhow, here's a bunch of pictures of old LEGOs. Enjoy.
