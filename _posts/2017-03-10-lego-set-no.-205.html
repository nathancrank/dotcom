Late last night, while browsing craigslist to get an idea of what people 
sell Legos for (it depends, but it's largely by weight in pounds), I 
stumbled across a NO. 205 set at a local thrift shop. So late this 
afternoon, I went and bought it. In store it appeared to have at least the 
majority of its parts, and the parts seemed roughly right for the supposed 
age. So I bought it.
