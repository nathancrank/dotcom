I've spent a lot of time playing Fallout 4. Most of that time has been spent crafting things, such as attempting to construct a [memory circuit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-28-failing-to-bring-tv-to-fallout %}). But by far the largest time-sink has been rebuilding Sanctuary.

I did this all on the PS4, with mods that enable more of the in game items in building mode. As should be immediately obvious if you've ever played the PS4 version, this town is massively over the settlement limit size. I managed to do this by finding a series of size-hacks. Originally anything you dropped and then removed would lower the settlement size; however, only a few days into this an update broke that. The second method I found was to remove a wire while in building mode with the desired item already selected. Once the wire is removed, you can place the item. During the build, the town was littered with conduits placed for my convenience. 

The following is a brief tour.
